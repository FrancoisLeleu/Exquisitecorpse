Sitation (Etienne)

Capitaine de Lorme was eating his favourite fruit on the deck of his boat. The sun was shining, the seagulls were sceaming, the sea was calm and steady. He was watching the sun rise and sais "What a perfect and peaceful day".


###### The solution to the problem (Adriana)
When the **Marquis de Carrina** arrived, _Capitaine de Lorne_ was not surprised at all. He expected the enemy. In fact, he was releaved that he wouldn't need to run anymore. The captain had a strong desire to win.
So that moment, he fought with all his power and, after a long battle, he was able finally to kill the enemy.
